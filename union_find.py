"""
Problem Set Dynamic connectivity.

The input is a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents an object of some type and we are to
interpret the pair p q as meaning p is connected to q. We assume that "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:

    symmetric: If p is connected to q, then q is connected to p.
    transitive: If p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r.
    reflexive: p is connected to p.

An equivalence relation partitions the objects into equivalence classes or connected components.

Our goal is to write a program that given a set number N, will initialize a data representation that we can then perform
the two operations:

    join p to q - Union Operation
    check if p is connected to q - is_connected Operation
